This will automatically set up the environment and start the server for you.

## Signing in - Demo Profiles 

To test student-related views and facilities, use the following account credentials upon sign-in:
* Email: `student@dlsu.edu.ph`
* Password: `student`

To test faculty (lab technician) views and facilities, use the following account credentials upon sign-in:
* Email: `admin@dlsu.edu.ph`
* Password: `admin`

## Signing up

To test student / faculty views and facilities via a newly created user account, navigate to "Sign Up" to create a new account. Take note that the following has been implemented:
* Simple input checking (i.e., passwords don't match, field missing, etc.) to test error message outputting
* Checking new email against existing accounts as to not disrupt logic for fetching user data from database
* Creating faculty (lab technician) account requires a faculty code to proceed. As of this implementation, the code is "i-am-faculty"
